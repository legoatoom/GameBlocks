## Description
GameBlocks Currently adds two new blocks. A chessboard and a checkerboard. Both crafted in a grid patter with dark oak and spruce pressure plates and spruce and oak pressure plates.
Craft Calcite and Deepslate for a Sack that contains game pieces. Right-click on a board to fill that boards pieces.
Then shift-right-click to reset the board.

Currently, there are no settings yet to change rules and whether to show tooltips however they are planned in the future.

#### Issues
This mod is still in beta so expect some bugs, if you have encountered any or have some feedback, go to the GitHub [issues](https://github.com/legoatoom/GameBlocks/issues) page.

#### Translations
I currently have US and GB and NL translations. 
If you want to help, that is great, however to avoid mistakes I will need people to confirm the translations.\
Thus, since I don't want to deal with that hassle I cannot confirm I will actually add new translations at this time.
